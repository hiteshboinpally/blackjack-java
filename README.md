# Blackjack Java
## Overview
This is an implemenation of the popular card game Blackjack with a few modifications for simplicity. These modifications include:
* Users can only hit/stand, there is no doubling down or splitting
* There is no insurance for dealer Blackjacks
* There is no bonus for user Blackjacks
* Aces are always treated as 11 (so dealer does not hit on a typical soft 17)

The implementation utilizes Java to create a command-line based game of Blackjack. It supports mutliple users, as well as having 
multiple decks in play. Please note that this implementation does some user checking, but there are ways to "break the game".

## Running the Program
In order to actually play the game, make sure you have Java installed. Then, complie/run the file "BlackjackClient.java", at which
point you should see the game begin in the command-line.
